This repository will be used for the SRM-Kzilla recruitment!

### Task Specifications:

---

**ToDo List**: Living a happening college life is not easy. There are so many assignments, appointments and fun stuff to do. Create a todo list app to manage all your tasks.



**Suggested Tasks**:


This project will test you App skills.
You have to create a ToDo list app which stores the data, and allows the user to create a new todo item, delete and update it.
The app can use an online backend (crudcrud.com) to keep a record of all the entries.

**Bonus Tasks**:

Using firebase or a backend gives you extra points. A good and unique UI carries a lot of points too.
The application will have authentication feature if you are opting to use a cloud provider for storage.
Your application needs to have a fully functional dark mode.

**Additional Notes**:

You need to upload the apk to drive and source code to GitHub. A proper README is also a must.

### Additional Information

- The app has a functional dark mode which can be accessed by clicking on the format-paint icon button prenet in the app bar.
