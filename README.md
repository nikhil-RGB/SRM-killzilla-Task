This repository will be used for the SRM-Killzilla recruitment!

### Task Specifications:

---

**ToDo List**: Living a happening college life is not easy. There are so many assignments, appointments and fun stuff to do. Create a todo list app to manage all your tasks.



**Suggested Tasks**:


This project will test you App skills.
You have to create a ToDo list app which stores the data, and allows the user to create a new todo item, delete and update it.
The app can use an online backend (crudcrud.com) to keep a record of all the entries.

**Bonus Tasks**:

Using firebase or a backend gives you extra points. A good and unique UI carries a lot of points too.
The application will have authentication feature if you are opting to use a cloud provider for storage.
Your application needs to have a fully functional dark mode.

**Additional Notes**:

You need to upload the apk to drive and source code to GitHub. A proper README is also a must.

### Notes:

1) The app has some values hard-coded on start, these can easily be changed with the functionalities provided.
2) As of now, I do not know how to connect my app to a backend, but am in the process of learning app development thorougly- therefore the tasks inputted will not          persist once the app is closed.<br>
3) Thank you to Killzilla for this wonderful learning oppurtunity!!
4) The Bonus-Tasks branch contains work which is aimed at improving the app and adding new features- once these are tested, the changes will be rebased on top of the      main branch.
